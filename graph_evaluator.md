# Graph Evaluator Implementation - Summary

## What We Built

We've successfully implemented **Issue #8: Core: Graph Evaluator - Execution Engine**, which is the orchestration brain of the system.

## Components Created

### 1. GraphEvaluator.java
The main orchestration engine with the following capabilities:

- **Graph Execution Management**
    - Start new graph executions with parameters
    - Create task executions for all tasks in a graph
    - Track execution state in Hazelcast

- **Task Scheduling**
    - Build DAG from graph definition
    - Find tasks ready to execute based on dependencies
    - Schedule regular (inline) tasks
    - Schedule and deduplicate global tasks
    - Publish work messages to worker queue

- **Event Handling**
    - Handle task completion events
    - Handle task failure events with retry logic
    - Re-evaluate graphs when tasks complete/fail
    - Update graph status based on task states

- **Global Task Deduplication**
    - Resolve global task keys with expression evaluation
    - Link multiple graphs to same global task execution
    - Use Hazelcast map locking for thread-safe operations
    - Notify all linked graphs when global task completes

- **Expression Evaluation**
    - Evaluate JEXL expressions in task arguments
    - Evaluate environment variables (graph + task)
    - Resolve parameters with proper scoping hierarchy

- **Status Management**
    - Update graph status (RUNNING → COMPLETED/FAILED/STALLED)
    - Handle terminal states properly
    - Detect when graphs are blocked

### 2. Event Classes
- **TaskCompletionEvent** - Published when task completes successfully
- **TaskFailureEvent** - Published when task fails
- Both are Serializable for Hazelcast event bus

### 3. WorkMessage
- Message sent to worker queue containing task execution details
- Includes command, args, env, timeout, attempt number
- Contains ExpressionContext for expression evaluation
- Serializable for Hazelcast queue

### 4. ExpressionContext (Updated)
- Made Serializable so it can be part of WorkMessage
- Maintains params, env, and task results

### 5. Comprehensive Tests
- Graph execution lifecycle
- Task scheduling and dependencies
- Task completion and failure handling
- Global task deduplication
- Expression evaluation in work messages
- All 139 tests passing ✅

## Key Features

### Parameter Resolution Hierarchy
Implements the 4-level hierarchy from the design:
1. Runtime invocation params (highest priority)
2. Graph task reference params
3. Global task defaults
4. Graph defaults (lowest priority)

### Global Task Deduplication
- Multiple graphs can reference the same global task with same parameters
- Only one execution happens
- All graphs are linked and notified on completion
- Uses Hazelcast map locking for thread-safety

### Dependency Management
- Uses JGraphT to build and analyze DAGs
- Finds ready tasks (all dependencies completed)
- Respects task dependencies when scheduling
- Handles parallel task execution

### Retry Logic
- Failed tasks retry up to configured limit
- New task execution created for each retry
- Tracks attempt number
- Permanent failure after max retries

### Status Tracking
- Graph: RUNNING → COMPLETED/FAILED/STALLED/PAUSED
- Task: PENDING → QUEUED → RUNNING → COMPLETED/FAILED/SKIPPED
- Automatic status updates based on task states

## What's Next

The GraphEvaluator is now complete and tested. The next logical components to implement would be:

1. **Issue #11: Worker: Task Executor** - The component that actually executes commands
2. **Issue #12: Worker: Worker Pool** - Multi-threaded worker pool that pulls from queue
3. **Issue #14: Storage: Event Store** - Persist events to JSONL files

The core orchestration engine is now ready and can:
- ✅ Accept graph execution requests
- ✅ Build DAGs and find ready tasks
- ✅ Schedule tasks to work queue
- ✅ Handle task completion/failure
- ✅ Deduplicate global tasks
- ✅ Update execution status
- ✅ Evaluate expressions

Once we implement the Worker components, we'll have an end-to-end executable workflow orchestrator!
