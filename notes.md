By the way, I was thinking that while we'll definitely want everything to start in one process in dev, in prod we'd want to be able to start orchestrator(s), the Hazelcast part (not sure what we'd call this, it needs a cool name), and workers separately. Maybe even a UI separately just so that it doesn't get laggy when the orchestration is busy.  I'm assuming you've thought of it, but I just wanted to check if we needed to add a note to the design.
